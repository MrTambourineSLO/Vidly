			/*	===	END TO END DEVELOPMENT	===	*/

- > IRL Scenario : Extend Vidly & add the ability to RECORD RENTALS
- > Before coding we need to UNDERSTAND how this use case works (talking to
client, who we're working for)
- > Example: Customer comes to the counter & hands movie to staff member,
	>> Staff member looks up customer in application & then adds each movie
	to the list of movies customer is about to rent - that's the end of this
	transaction
- > APPROACH: We can start from FRONT||BACK END (it's matter of personal preference.
Mosh advises starting from BE though - because complexity from frontend can
leak into backend design.)
- > BACKEND: we focus on I/O of the application
	>> INPUT: id of CUSTOMER & MOVIES (how we get to customer info is for now
	irrelevant)
	Like making a building - we first focus on big picture - "skeleton" where are
	tables and chairs is at this point not relevant.
	>> OUTPUT: No output (we don't give customer a check or order/transaction ID )
	>> we need ACTION: that frontend is going to call
		it can either be put (depending if we're returning markup || data) in:
		>>> MVC CONTROLLER or
		>>> API CONTROLLER (we're going to use as we have so far
		it has also advantage - we can build different types of clients that
		consume this API)
	=> EXERCISE 1 - We know I/O for this case.
	Create an API frontend will call when user submits the form for New Rental Use Case:
	Just create ACTION w/ correct INPUT & OUTPUT - Implementation = empty || simple
	response
	 * I created it like this in CustomersController
	 * The right way was to create a new "NewRentalsController" in Api Controllers
	 w/ action which accepts New RentalDto (decorated w/ HTTPPOST)
		>> RentalDto has two props - int CustomerId and List<int> MovieIds
	>> Implementation of this API
	>> 1st Look at domain models
		>>> Does our current domain model support rentals?
		(We have Movie and Genre model)
		>>> No? Nothing here describes a rental
		UML
		CUSTOMER		---rents--->*		MOVIE
		CUSTOMER	*<---can be rented---	MOVIE
		-> Ergo: we need MANY-MANY association between these 2 classes
		-> The association NEEDS ATTRIBUTES!!!
		**************
		*	RENTAL	 *
		**************
		|DateRented	 |
		|DateReturned|
		|			 |
		|____________|
			>> So Association(Rental) needs to know when movie was
			rented and when it was returned
			>> Rental is association class in UML - and it's named
			after association. So if association is "rents" and
			"can be rented" - association class' name is Rental
		-> Implementation is actually easy - our Rental class
		should have properties depicted as well as 2 navigation
		properties (ergo CUSTOMER and MOVIE) + as per EF every 
		table needs an ID
	=> EXERCISE 2 - Add Rental to our Domain Model and use CF migration
	to bring DB up to date

			/*	===	BUILDING THE SIMPLEST API	===	*/

EXERCISE 2 SOLUTION:
My solution:
		public int Id { get; set; }
        [Required]
        public int CustomerId { get; set; }
        [Required]
        public int MovieId { get; set; }
        public DateTime DateRented { get; set; }
        public DateTime DateReturned { get; set; }
        public Movie Movie { get; set; }
        public Customer Customer { get; set; }
Video solution:
		public int Id { get; set; }
        public DateTime DateRented { get; set; }
        public DateTime? DateReturned { get; set; }
        [Required]
		public Movie Movie { get; set; }
        [Required]
		public Customer Customer { get; set; }
		-> NOTE: DateReturned is NULLABLE
		-> NOTE: We didn't ADD IDs but straight up OBJECTS
		WHY? EF will make sure that DB ACCEPTS REFERENCES (as in FK)
		FOR THOSE TABLES
Next: *In ApplicationDbContext we add DbSet of Rental
	  * Create migration and update db
	  * Now we're ready to IMPLEMENT an API
	  : Start a happy path - forget Edge Cases, Validations etc
	  -> In our action we need to get Customer and Movies based on the IDs
	  our DTO gives us
	  -> Then for each movie we need to create a new Rental object and 
	  get it to a DB
	=> EXERCISE 3:
	Implement the simplest API then Use POSTMAN to call it, make sure that
	you get all movie IDs in a DB
	(See previous commit for solution - it's commented in the code)
Next: * In creating a rental we have to take into account AVAILABILTY
		of the movie

		***************
		*	MOVIE	  *
		***************								_______________
		|NumberInStock|	--------------------------*|	RENTAL	   |
		|			  |							   |_______________|
		|			  |
		|_____________|

		*Does our current DM allow us to track the availability of the movie?
		-> It does (Ergo- Availability = NumberInStock-ActiveRentals)
		-> BUT - this would require a lot of calls to DB for calculating 
		Availability
		-> Better solution: 
		*****************
		*	MOVIE	    *	Initially NumberAvailable is same as number
		*****************	In stock, but when customer rents we decrease
		|NumberInStock  |	it by 1. Same for when customer returns it.
		|			    |
		|NumberAvailable|			  
		|_______________|

=> EXERCISE 4:
	Update availability of the movies - TIP: Add this new prop to DM, update-db
	modify logic in our Action
	-> We have to add new property NumberAvailable to Movie DM
	-> We add migration and in Up();
	we add 
	 Sql("UPDATE Movies SET NumberAvailable = NumberInStock");
	 to set NumberAvailable automatically for existing records.
	 In MovieController's Save method add NumberAvailable = NumberInStock on an
	 instance of the movie.
	 Also in Api MovieController's Create Movie make sure to initialize that value.
	 In api's for loop we add movie.NumberAvailable--;
