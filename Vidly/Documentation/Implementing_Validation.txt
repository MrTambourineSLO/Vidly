- > In customer ctrl Save action we have Customer as parameter
- > MVC when it populates it using request data it checks to see if 
this object is valid based on DATA ANNOTATIONS
	>> We can use ModelState prop to get info on validation data
	ModelState.IsValid() is bool, so we can change app flow:
	if(!ModelState.IsValid()){
		var viewModel = new CustomerFormViewModel(){
			Customer = customer,
			MembershipTypes = _context.MembershipTypes.ToList()
		}
		return View("CustomerForm",ViewModel)
	}
		>>> Ergo we return same view w/ same (invalid) data (which has to be VM! as 
		was defined) for user to correct
- > To add Validation there are 3 steps to follow
	>> Add data annotations on entities
	>> Validate ModelState to change flow of the program
	(if not valid return the same view)
	>> Add VALIDATION MESSAGES to our FORM
		>>> Add placeholder for validation messages next to each
		field that requires validation
		Eg Customer.Name is req and is limited w/ 255 chars 
		Under Label & TB
		we add @Html.ValidationMessageFor(m => m.Customer.Name)
